# ACID-1
This application exemplifies a common problem found in webshops.

It is your job to:
* Determine the **nature** of the anomaly
* Determine the correct **isolationlevel**
* **Explain** the mechanics of the anomaly

You should use the included docker-compose file to create a Microsoft SQL server container in Docker Desktop
Note that:
* the user is "sa"
* the password is "@12tf56so"

Create a database called "xxx". The application itself will seed the database for the purpose.
